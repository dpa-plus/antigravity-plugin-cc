# Prompting Gemini 3 through Antigravity

You drive `agy` (Antigravity, Gemini 3) in print mode through the companion's `delegate`, `review`, and `resume` subcommands. Print mode is headless: one prompt in, one result out. The agent cannot stop to ask you a clarifying question, so the prompt you send is the whole brief. Write it like a work order for a fast, literal junior engineer.

This guide is the short version. The depth lives in two reference files:
- **[Recipes](references/gemini-3-recipes.md)** — copy-paste templates for fixes, features, review, investigation, refactor, and tests.
- **[Anti-patterns](references/gemini-3-antipatterns.md)** — the common mistakes and their fixes.

## How Gemini 3 behaves (and how to prompt for it)

Based on Google's Gemini 3 developer/prompting guides and practitioner write-ups:

- **It follows instructions literally.** If you say "fix the bug," it fixes *a* bug its own way. If you say "make `parseDate` return `null` on empty input and add a test for it," you get exactly that. Spell out the target behavior, not the vibe.
- **It is terse by default.** Gemini 3 gives direct answers and skips narration unless you ask for it. If you want a written plan or an explanation of the change, request it explicitly.
- **It plans and reasons over multiple steps.** It is strong at decomposing a goal into steps and executing them. Give it the *goal* and the *constraints*; let it own the *how*. Over-scripting the steps fights the model.
- **It handles long context well, but cares about order.** Put the data/code/diff first, then your instruction last. Anchor the ask to the material ("Based on the diff above, ..."). Critical constraints — especially "do NOT touch X" — go at the **end** of the prompt; Gemini 3 can drop a negative constraint that appears too early in a long prompt.
- **One markup style, used consistently.** Markdown headings or simple labels are enough. Don't mix XML tags and Markdown in the same prompt.

You do **not** pick the model in the prompt. There is no model flag on `agy` — the model is set with `/model` inside the TUI and persisted. Never instruct the agent to "use Gemini 3 Pro" or pass `-m`.

## A solid delegate prompt has five parts

1. **Goal** — one sentence, the outcome you want.
2. **Acceptance criteria** — how *you* will know it's done (tests pass, endpoint returns X, build is green). This is what turns a vague request into a checkable one.
3. **Where to look** — the files, dirs, or modules that matter. Saves the agent a blind search and keeps it on target.
4. **Scope boundaries** — what NOT to touch (other modules, public API shape, formatting of unrelated files). Put these last.
5. **Output expectation** — code change only, or also a short summary of what changed and why.

Keep it tight. A focused 8-line brief beats a 40-line essay; over-stuffed context buries the actual ask.

## Read-only vs write-capable

`delegate` is **write-capable by default** — it can edit files and run commands. Choose deliberately:

| Use | When |
|-----|------|
| `--read-only` | Investigation, root-cause, "explain how X works," planning, anything where you want analysis without touching the tree. Safe to run unattended. |
| `--sandbox` | You want it to *try* changes (run commands, scratch edits) but keep them contained from your real working tree. |
| write-capable (default) | You actually want the fix/feature applied to the repo, and you'll review the diff after. |

`review` is already read-only and sandboxed — it never edits, it just reports on the diff.

If you're unsure whether a task should write, start `--read-only` to get the plan, then re-run write-capable (or `resume` the conversation) to apply it.

## Limits to be honest about

- **Print mode won't ask you questions.** Ambiguity becomes a guess. Front-load the detail.
- **Preview quota.** On quota exhaustion `agy` exits cleanly with empty output; the companion surfaces `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (429) ... Resets in <dur>`. If you see that, wait for the reset — re-prompting won't help.
- **Auth is the user's job.** OAuth via Google account, no API key. The plugin never logs anyone in.
