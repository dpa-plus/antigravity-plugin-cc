Cancel a running background Antigravity job. Defaults to the latest running job; pass a `[job-id]` to target a specific one.

Run exactly this and show the output verbatim:

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/antigravity.mjs" cancel "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Present the companion's stdout as-is. Do not summarize, reformat, or add commentary. Use `/antigravity:status` to see which jobs are still running.
